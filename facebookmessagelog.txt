This is the group. I think we should use this with Cassandra and the fire house, but what do I know http://lsa.colorado.edu
LSA @ CU Boulder
lsa.colorado.edu
Gnip
Plz

David
what do you mean
/?
Can we use gnip haha
Very im8lar to firehose
Similar

David
sure
But much more dope b/c it gets 99% opposed to 2% twitter api
Dope
Of tweets
Could run tensor flow or sklearn on it
For machine learning

David
sounds awesome,but if we do simpler math like LSA we can populate cassandra in real time
Hmmm i know very little about dbs
Ill check it out

David
good, we shouldn't know shit about what were doing if its going to be fun
Yes true
FEB 1ST, 2:18PM

Amir
Hi gues would you like to have a quick meeting after class today?
Sure
FEB 1ST, 4:15PM

David
Matt if you want to use machine learning like tensorflow, we need a reason to train in with tweets. I have a couple ideas now for tensorflow applications and LSA applications, but ideas are more fun than important. Maybe profitable, probably not.
that was bad wording
we will talk after class
Yea i gotchu
Maybe emoji analysis lol
Copy southpark

David
We could graph the way the online world feels per hour or minute
or month
With LSA we could find the most similar tweet to your own tweet
FEB 1ST, 9:35PM

David
LSA has been used in tech as early as 2001, Pearson uses it in mastering astr/bio/physics
it's at least well tested, and useful
FEB 3RD, 3:11AM

Troy
Yo I realize I'm joining in on this late, I think we should use Cassandra db too it sounds like it has fast availability and large scalability
I don't know anything about Lsa and tenserfow. They sound difficult but I also haven't researched them. However, I'm open to learn new fun software and for anything that's realistic to our experience

google.com
only cu accounts can view but that's my idea, I believe its within our scope
FEB 6TH, 12:07PM

David
What do you all think of my idea
Wanna implement it?

Amir
Hi do you mean using LSA?
if yes it interesting idea, I did some research about it . it is not too hard to implement it with python

David
Did you read the google doc?

Amir
no
reading now
yes it is intersting for me ,

David
we can show greg the idea today if you guys all approve

Amir
sure good idea
I can setup the github and add in a sample twitter parser
unless you already did david, can I get your guys user info

David
dape5519 i did no github
cool ill set it up

Amir
mine is:
amirkashi

Troy
kayne10
i'm gonna make the repo private for now so that we can add keys

David
Sounds gucci
did you guys see the stuff I just added to doc
although I'm def getting ahead of myself

David
but you guys think we should show greg
Yea more like ask if he thinks its feasible

David
I emailed it to him
new repo, i fucked up the first one
FEB 6TH, 3:23PM

David
Greg said think it is feasible, but don't underestimate how difficult it is to detect emotion/sentiment from small pieces of text.

in my experience, even the best algorithms only get sentiment correct for about 60% of tweets.

it can get more accurate with specific domains. sarcasm is one of the problems you'll encounter....

David
Makes sense.

Amir
cool thanks

David
We can still do that or something similar, but my plan wasn't on the money
Def something similar
FEB 6TH, 5:15PM

David
I talked with him and he thinks it's a good project and he almost wanted us to run it the sentiment problem ourselves. But after learning that we could use the twitter api to pull data all the way back to 2006. I think my idea is still good. Instead of using emotion strings for lsa we should use strings related to specific past events and grab tweets from that time period to test and refine our algorithms
Never done streaming of specific dates did you check out how to implement it tho?
FEB 6TH, 7:48PM
what email are you using for greg
his gmail or cu email

Amir
I used his cu , I think you can find it on lecture 1 slides
FEB 9TH, 1:43PM

David
I just talked with someone who took this class and accidentally uploaded the keys to AWS
we aren't going to do that
Haahha
Yea
Hell no

David
they stole 7500$ of services from the team and Amazon refunded it because Greg is total boss
Hahahah
Yeaaa thats why our repo is private haha
/in Greg's files
MAR 7TH, 12:09PM
yo added you all to pivitol
and have psswords for other stuff should we make a doc for it or more config files

David
Sounds great
MAR 13TH, 10:49AM

Amir
hi do we need to make and slide today ?
MAR 13TH, 12:22PM

David
I think we mainly have to present our ideas
MAR 13TH, 3:34PM

David
And pivotal
I'm sick today. I've been in bed all day. Don't know if I should go to class
All good i can talk
But add somestuff to pivotal
And imma try to make a lil jupyter notebook to present
Rn

David
go for it

David
i added 4 things to pivotal

David
omg the project though, really tough
The data is still so unorganized but i can talk about that

Troy
So are we presenting what we have done?

David
yes but through pivitol
I think we are in class today
Also
And i can talk about the data theory or someshit, just pushed the notebook to github
MAR 20TH, 1:43PM
got gniip working with a curl command, we should maybe meet up for a minute after class today or wednesday so we each know what to do over break
unless you're going to a tropical beach somewhere lol

David
I'm down to work over break, I haven't done enough yet.
Give me work to do. After class. I have a meeting at 7.
Its all good, we just need to all be in the same page before leavin for break

Amir
Hi I found how to run Cassandra in multiple nodes
I want to switch to learn storm in case we need it
Thats great if it wouldnt take too long getting it on maybe we should all get it running
Storm is almost definitely necessary

Amir
Good I will start learning it do
Do you want we have a quick meeting tonight after class?

David
Do we need to make the gnip api a producer in kafka?

Amir
I am not sure, about it
I am also not sure if we need to save all twits in data base or the twits we are interested to work on it
Only the ones we need
Kafka would take in the tweets filter some pass the reordered result to the next part of the architecture
I think it would be the producer for kafkas broker though
MAR 21ST, 5:47PM

Amir
Hi I am uploading one node to our shared project folder
it is 2gb , I think it should be there in 1 hour as google tell me
i wrote a short instruction how to use it , please let me know if you have any question.
I can give you copy of all nodes if you want tomorrow using a flash drive . one none is good for testing
I running it on 3 nodes now
Thanks ill try it out tomorrow and let you know what happens

Amir
cool thanks
Thats nice though

David
Awesome!
MAR 24TH, 4:21PM

Amir
hi , I am uploading the test server to the project drive now , you can get it sometime today it think it take about 2 hours
it is the same as others but has qui which make it easier to work , and it works on a single node. we can run our test in this server
its name is xubuntu_01_base_cassandra_test.ova
let me know if you have question
let me know if you have any question about it
have good break
Thanks ill check it out
MAR 28TH, 4:32PM

David
kafka is spun up on a single node

How To Install Apache Kafka on Ubuntu 14.04 | DigitalOcean
Apache Kafka is a popular distributed message broker designed to handle large volumes of real-time data efficiently. A Kafka cluster is not only highly scalable and fault-tolerant, but it also has a much higher throughput compared to other message bro
digitalocean.com

David
that's the tutorial I used
steps 6 & 7 are useful knowlegde for testing im going to try and install a kafka measuring tool too
I'm about the go slackline with a google employee and netflix employee, both know about the tools we are using. Last time I talked with him he said that storm is being replaced with spark in the industry.

David
I'll upload the VM sometime soon

Amir
Cool thanks
MAR 29TH, 10:53AM
Yea sounds good and have fun david
APR 4TH, 7:04PM

Amir
hi do you know what we should read for tomorrow quize?
APR 5TH, 12:44PM
13-
13 is the first one itll cover up to now

Troy
I feel like it will cover mostly elastic search stuff
i missed that day fuck

Troy
Lecture 14 and 15 cover it. Still very dense slides tho

Still tryin to meet at 11?

Amir
Yes works for me, let know if you can't
Just wanted to make sure everone was still down before goin over there

David
Yeah
Hm ill call troy in a minute

David
I may be 5 or 10 late. I'm eating breakfast now
Im about to skate over, will also be 5 mins late

Amir
I will stop at math library to see if there is a free study room
Good call let us know

David
I'm here and it's empty
We should work here
The conference room is empty

Amir
Good
I will be there in a min
Which one
Gemmell or csel

David
Csel

Amir
Csell, I can go gemmel to see if they have room if you want
Cool

David
So yesterday, I found out that this is a ridiculously hard to understand without a lot of experience. Now I can either do cassandra kafka spark on a single node or we can do what matt suggested and make a front end
gnip search
but we are running out of time.
I was also recomened to try ansible
i think cassandra spark kafka would be dope
if its doable

Troy
I agree

David
I believe that single node is doable
cluster is not
at this point.
but, on a single node I should be able to do everything and host it on aws

Troy
That's fine we just started learning about these technologies so as long as we pursue a realistic final product, we have something dope to brag about on our githubs
im with troy
it doesnt matter if we lose like 1% of info scraped
or even 2 or 3 !
single node is chillen
APR 11TH, 7:09PM

David
Assuming we are doing everything on a single node.. what does that node need to have installed
currently we got java openjdk,kafka +a kafka-python module,plus cassandra, we are installing through yum so if know a piece of software you want to be on there for search or hosting certain file types I need the YUM install for centos 6

Troy
Which software is responsible for feeding datasets to Cassandra

David
we have that

Troy
Cool
And I bet it's still possible to connect to Cassandra on a node app even tho Cassandra is in docker container

David
I'm not sure how that works, I'd check for infrastructure
APR 12TH, 11:11AM

David
I also need to know how we are storing the data in cassandra

David
That would be up to Troy since he is designing the website. The data tables in cassandra should be formated with the website interface in mind. All I need from that is cassandra cql commands to automatically initialize the table. Here is an example
CREATE KEYSPACE test_time WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor' : 1};

CREATE TABLE test_time.sent_received(
 time_sent TEXT,
 time_received TEXT,
PRIMARY KEY (time_sent)
);

Troy
Key spaces are a collection of tables right?
Also I can work on a data model for Cassandra in my next class

David
CQL treats the database (Keyspace) as a container of tables.
Programmers use cqlsh: a prompt to work with CQL or separate application
language drivers.

David
For everyone, the most important thing to understand about docker containers is you build them automatically and they start working automatically as well. SO we have to have thing working correctly on boot. If there is a problem it will be evident but the only way to fix it would be rebuilding with a new approach, Rebuilding takes roughly 30 minutes so PLEASE iron everything out to be perfect and understand what your working on. If we run into unforseen errors and can't fix them right away we could be screwed.

David
I can explain more in class today.
Are we still using kafka
Or straight to spark,  cause we don't care about 100% retained

David
At this point, going to straight to spark may be more difficult. Since I already have them interfacing.
Alright maybe not sure
APR 12TH, 1:32PM
anyone know how to make a kafka topic and david does your stuff include a consumer
im not sure if kafkas gonna work, reading some documentation, hella confused
eh might be wrong
eh fuck kafka imma look into sending straight to spark
i think spark is very doable maybe dockerize cassandra instances?... we can talk in class tho
wrote a shell script to run the search for links on #jobs tweets to a json
might format it a lil
more

Troy
https://docs.datastax.com/en/latest-dse/datastax_enterprise/spark/sparkJavaApi.html
Getting started with the Spark Cassandra Connector Java API
The Spark Cassandra Connector Java API allows you to create Java applications that use Spark to analyze Cassandra data.
docs.datastax.com

David
Troy, that's about taking data from spark and putting it into Cassandra. We got that infrastructure installed. What I asked for was the data storage format in cql. As in how things are inside of Cassandra.
When you use Cassandra you need to create a table with cql before you fill it. I'm asking you to create a table that will interface with your website.
I've got spark to Cassandra in python. But we can pull from Cassandra without python if need be.

Troy
I have a couple schemas written down. Since we are using a cluster I am a confused on the replication factor
I can show u in class

Amir
Replication factor is 3

Troy
Cool

Amir
Depends on cluster number, we have 3 server

Troy
SimpleStrategy or NetworkTopogrqphyStrargy
?

Amir
If we have more it is recommended to have at least 3
Yes
First one , I am not sure about second

Troy
Me too

David
Before we had a single node as the plan
Why are we saying cluster again? Earlier I said I that getting the cluster to run on AWS is too hard for me to do in a week

Troy
I was unclear you were referring to Cassandra
Not a problem working with a single node

Amir
Oh replication factor should be 1 for single nod ,

Troy
Gotcha thanks

Amir
Professor said he don't care if we have a single nod, architectures is what he care
Thanks all for hard work, see you at class

David
Okay, the example I posted above in cql is a table on a single node.
That's the move
Doable

David
MON 11:55AM
want to meet in a hour or two
class is cancelled

David
I can't do an hour or two. But I can do 3
norlin ?
im good with that

Troy
I'm good with that too

Amir
I have calass from 4-5:15

David
sure
alright ill be up there at like 230 til like 4 then i guess

David
I'm not totally sure I can make 3
i feel we can always just message and work alone doesn't really matter
just due really fuckin soon

Amir
That time works for me

David
agreed
david does your docker container for spark know how to take in tweets?
or should i try to write something for that?

David
If you give me the api py files today. I can deal with that.
I have no idea what the format is from the file. But it's set up to take anything in. We just have to make sure it does it correctly
MON 1:50PM

Amir
hi I am at norlit now and will leave here 3:40
Sounds good
Ill be there soon
Where? Science stacks?
Im here also

Amir
where are you? the table I have is under air conditoner , I am freezing now
https://cubigdata.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
cubigdata.signin.aws.amazon.com

Come when you guys can
Gotta make some changes
Gnip crashes too much goin to tweepy

Troy
On my way now

David
On my way too
Word were in the middle of the science stacks
TUE 10:31AM

David
Hey I just realized I have a midterm Thursday. I can still meet today with amir and tomorrow with everyone
TUE 1:58PM

David
Greg asked what error we got?
I'm trying to run the gnip api with a configuration file. What should the type of the file be
.gnip
Name it that
The other file requires that

David
is this the error
Yea tried running python 1 2 and 3
And my friend has also been getting the error

David
that error
and it used to work?
Yes
Idk his error but neither of ours work anymore
And we modified nothing

David
https://github.com/DrSkippy
which one of his
I think full search
It should be the same name as on the matt branch of github
TUE 4:48PM

David
Docker file and other usable things under ksc in master
TUE 8:31PM

David
okay, we are using gnip
matt
there is no issue with gnip, what happened is we have a data type switch.

Troy
Is it back on?

David
It was never off
we all share settings
some groups changed the data format.
Matt

Troy
Ok well we are still running low on time and we still need to fill our database so I don't mind using gnip or tweepy as long as we can gather datasets

David
Chiraq said he had the same issue and I just emailed him with the image asking for the help he offered to give.

David
eh, he sent an email back saying we have a slightly different error. his involved the word key, I CC'd you. BUT GNIP DOES WORK
According to chiraq its been working

anyone want to work a bit at 12
i could maybe help you with the db troy

Troy
I cant at 12, but i can at anytime but 12

David
I'll work at 12! Matt bring a fucking charger
I'll work all day with yall

Troy
coool
nah
i didnt
haha

David
Go get a fucking charger
i have 4 hours of power
where at, Norlin science stacks?
Doesn't really matter tho, can't get much done without populated db

Amir
Hi were do you want to work?
I learned how to make point map with geo json , it is pretty easy , I pushed  one sample to the git hub
check map_04_json.html
Nice I don't think our database has anything in it though, maybe test with a file
What kind of format does it want the Geo coords
Where we worked in norlin last time in the back?
Science stacks? I'd go at 12

Amir
Yes norlin works
I tested with a some location , I am using my API key , not sure how many calls we can have .
true that
down to work on that at norlin at 12 til my comp dies

David
Here
im about to go after my class im in
be there soon

Troy
I'll see you guys there after my class
sounds good going to rece for os?

Troy
It's cancelled
oh word see ya at 1 then
troy when are you done

Troy
I'm out in 5
